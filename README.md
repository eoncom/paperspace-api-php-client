# PHP Client Library for the Paperspace API

Â©2017 Manuel Kiessling


## About

This project provides an Open API Specification compatible spec of the
[Paperspace API](https://paperspace.github.io/paperspace-node/index.html), and uses this spec to auto-generate a PHP
client based on Guzzle which can be used to work with the API.

The resulting client is provided as a library through the Composer ecosystem. 


## Installation

tbd


## Using the client library

This project adds a thin wrapper around the generated code.


## How to auto-generate the API client

The PHP API client is generated using [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) 2.3.0.

The definition file `api-definitions/<api-version>/paperspace-api-swagger-definition.yml` serves as the input
specification, and generated sources are placed in
`src-generated/paperspace-api-swagger-generated-client/<api-version>`.

The only currently supported `<api-version>` is 0.1.1.

In order to (re-)generate the client code, proceed as follows:

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen
    cd swagger-codegen
    git checkout 2.3.0
    mvn clean package -DskipTests

    cd <folder with this README.md file>
    ./bin/generate-client.sh ~/swagger-codegen/modules/swagger-codegen-cli/target/swagger-codegen-cli.jar
